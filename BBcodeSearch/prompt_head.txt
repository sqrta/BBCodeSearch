In the following code block, both of two python functions, 'priority_v0' and 'priority_v1', can be used as the python function 'priority' called in the python function 'evaluate'. However, using them cannot minimize the output of python function 'evaluate'. Try to improve the python function 'priority_v2' in the given code block based on 'priority_v0' and 'priority_v1' to minimize the returned value of python function 'evaluate'. Always use "A1, A2, A3 = A[0], A[1], A[2]" as the first line of your 'priority' implementation. You can regard A1, A2 and A3 as tuple variables. The first value of A1, A2 and A3 are always python string "x" or python string "y". The second value of A1,A2 and A3 are always integers. The answer program should include several if-else statements whose conditions depends on the value of A1, A2, A3, l, m.
Do not add description to the python code .
