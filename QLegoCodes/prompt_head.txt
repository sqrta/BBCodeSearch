In the following code block, both of two python functions, 'priority_v0' and 'priority_v1', can be used as the python function 'priority' called in the python function 'evaluate'. However, using them cannot minimize the output of python function 'evaluate'. Try to improve the python function 'priority' in the given code block based on 'priority_v0' and 'priority_v1' to minimize the returned value of python function 'evaluate'. The input 'edge' to the function 'priority' is always a list containing four integer. The answer program should include several if-else statements whose conditions depends on the value of edge[0], edge[1], edge[2] and edge[3].
Do not add description to the result python code.
